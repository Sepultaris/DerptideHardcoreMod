This mod was created by [Elorin's Cursed Remains](https://github.com/Sepultaris)

This is a port of the hardcore mechanics from ValHeel. 
This mod was created mainly as an exercise so that I could learn how to use the Harmony Mod support system within ACEmulator.
And for use on The Derptide server, hence the name.

Thank you to [Aquafir](https://github.com/aquafir/ACE) for taking the time to answer my questions.
